#My First Post

This is my first post and I am using it to test:
*Markdown Syntax
*Jekyll
*Other Stuff

An example of *Other Stuff* is the possibility to *write code* such as:

```python
def myfunc():
   #do stuff
   return value

```
But now I wonder if and how I can add live javascript stuff to my posts... more on this later :fire:
